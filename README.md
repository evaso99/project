# project
The project repo includes files created for Assignment 6 of the Data Science toolbox course. 

Most of the files were forked from a repo. They were then renamed under a better naming system and reorganized into folders that would be easier to follow.

Lastly, an environment was created for the project repo, in which Python 3.12 and libraries needed to run the Report.ipynb were installed, and that the environemnt is available in Jupyter Lab.
